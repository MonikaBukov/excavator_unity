# Bucketwheel Excavator in Unity

Interactive Excavator Project: Explore an interactive simulation featuring a realistic bucket wheel excavator and character control. Take command of the excavator, navigate character movements, and encounter dynamic camera views for an engaging virtual experience. Includes real-time object destruction functionality for added interactivity.

## How to Play

- Movement: 	Excavator using WASD keys: W (Forward), S (Back), A (Turn Left), D (Turn Right)
- Avatar controls and the using WASD keys: W (Forward), S (Back), A (Run Left), D (Run Right)
- Mouse(Rotating)
- Interacting: toggling between the two is  using the E key
- Excavator wheel:	Use number key (1) to spin up (turn on) the excavator wheel and number key (2) to spin down (turn off) the excavator wheel.
- Arm Rotation Control: 	Number key (3) to pivot left and number key (4) to pivot right.
- Excavator Arm	Use number key (5) to move up the excavator arm and number key (6) to move down.
- Cameras	Cameras can be “p” for a mini-map and left and right click to turn the view of the following camera.

## About the Project

**Unity Project Highlights:**

In my Unity project, I've achieved precise control dynamics, ensuring the vehicle moves as expected, including independent arm movement. The player character's seamless navigation and the addition of a pickup animation enhance the user experience. There's potential for future enhancements like jumping, crouching, and a climbing animation for vehicle entry.

**Camera Management:**

The camera control system provides effective functionality, although I'm exploring ways to improve the click-to-rotate mechanism for smoother player interaction. A standout feature is the inclusion of a minimap. I'm also considering the addition of static cameras that players can switch between for exploration, both indoors and outdoors. Smooth camera transitions during vehicle entry and exit could enhance immersion.

**Particle Systems:**

Seamless integration of particle systems with the environment adds a layer of interactivity. I'm exploring the possibility of expanding this by introducing particle emitters within buildings, creating effects like rock particles kicking up dirt.

**Physics System:**

The physics system adds depth to the project. I'm considering opportunities to showcase more physics interactions within the level to further engage players.

**Audio Integration:**

Sound greatly enhances enjoyment and immersion in the project. This attention to detail contributes to the overall appeal.
